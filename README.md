This is a series of articles briefly discussing the Streamlit application framework with a focus on developing Streamlit Components. The aim is to show how I integrated Auth0 authentication in Streamlit and the architecture and trade-off decisions I made. There are some new features in the latest version of Streamlit that make Auth0 integration easy, namely the framework now natively supports OAuth and programmable session state.

I will enhance a simple simple Streamlit app to include both user and API authentication (using `access_token`, and `id_token`  respectively).

The articles in this series are:

1. [Introduction to Streamlit and Streamlit Components](./article-1/introduction-to-streamlit-and-streamlit-components.markdown)
2. [TBD] Streamlit User and API Authentication
3. [TBD] Deploying Streamlit Component Apps to Heroku and Streamlit Sharing, and
4. [TBD] A Secure Enterprise Streamlit Architecture Blueprint (with Cloud + Proxy Authentication and Containers)
5. [TBD] Bonus article ideas: Authenticated NLP application to train a Named Entity Recogniser using spaCy and Hugging Face Transformer pipelines, Authenticated stocks screener and stock sentiment analysis application, Authenticated Recurrent Deep Neural Network stock price prediction application
