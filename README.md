This is a series of articles briefly discussing the Streamlit application framework with a focus on developing Streamlit Components. The aim is to show how I integrated Auth0 authentication in Streamlit and the architecture and trade-off decisions I made. There are some new features in the latest version of Streamlit that make Auth0 integration easy, namely the framework now natively supports OAuth and programmable session state.

I will enhance a simple simple Streamlit app to include both user and API authentication (using `access_token`, and `id_token`  respectively).

The articles in this series are:

1. [Introduction to Streamlit and Streamlit Components](./article01/Readme.md)
2. [Streamlit User and API Authentication](./article02/Readme.md)
3. [Deploying Streamlit Component Apps to Heroku and Streamlit Sharing](./article03/Readme.md), and
4. [A Secure Enterprise Streamlit Architecture Blueprint](./article04/Readme.md) (with Cloud + Proxy Authentication and Containers)

A bonus article describes an authenticated NLP appplication to train a Named Entity Recogniser using spaCy and Hugging Face Transformer pipelines.
